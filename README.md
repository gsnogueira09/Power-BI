# Power BI for Data Science

Data Visualizations created during the course Power BI for Data Science from Data Science Academy

Simple datasets were used to learn how to create the graphs

The projects and the visualizations are attached in Power BI and PDF. The Project description and the graphs are in Portuguese, except the graph from Project

Important notes
* The questions 5 and 6 in Project 7 could not be answered due to the lack of data in the dataset. The information was confirmed in the course.
* Project 8 requested that the visualisation were created for smartphones, but it was changed for a Power BI Desktop view.
